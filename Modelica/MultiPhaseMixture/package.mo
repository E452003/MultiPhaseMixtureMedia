<p><span style=\"font-family: MS Shell Dlg 2;\">MultiPhaseMixture is a library for multi-phase multi-component fluids. It uses a model based interface which is in line with the Modelica spirit of equation based modelling. The model based interface makes it possible to implement a thermo property model using a declarative approach. The library has an interface to the C-interface externalMultiPhaseMixture which makes it possible to use properties from an external property package.</span></p>
